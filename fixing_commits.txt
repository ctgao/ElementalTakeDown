HOW TO: Fix your git commits!

The issue: my SSH git commits weren't registering onto Github

SOLUTION:
1. Check the git config file ($HOME/.gitconfig - usually .gitconfig). Can be the global file
   or the local repository file.
2. Make sure there's a name and email associated with your account. If your email is set to private,
   use the auto-generated one from github and it'll appear on your account.

IN THE CASE: that your commits are already pushed to github, not to worry! We can fix that!
It takes some finagling and some confidence in using Github through command-line so I heavily advise caution.
1. git rebase -i --root (starts an interactive rebase by showing a list of all commits in a file)
2. VIM opens up. Select the commits you want to modify by changing 'pick' to 'edit'.
   If you would like to change all the commits, enable line numbers with 'set nu'
   and perform the following replace: :1,Ns/pick/edit/g (where N is the line number of the last line)
2.5 Exit VIM with ':w' ':q' to write (save) the file and then quit the file.
3. Through command line, choose 'git commit --amend' or 'git rebase --continue'.
   'git commit --amend -author="name <email@example.com>"'
4. When the process is done, check your progress with 'git log --format=fuller'
   This will show you all of your commits and the full history, with author, committer, and dates for each.
5. Likely, the commit date is the current date/time. To fix this, run
   'git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date -root' to change all commit dates to author dates.
6. Doing a 'git status' now is going to show you that your branch has diverged from the remote branch.
   'git push -f origin main' to get the remote Github repo to match your local version of it.
